To start, we'll need to create a new Hygraph project. You can add a blank project or start from the [Hygraph Getting Started Project](https://app.hygraph.com/clone/4d65d295cd1e4912aa401fb15f72d40d?name=GS2023%20Stage%201).

## Adding a REST Remote Source

The first step in creating a remote source in Hygraph is to add it to the project's Schema. Navigate to the Schema section of your project and click the plus by the Remote Sources section.

Since we want to use remote content in our project, the first step is to create a Remote Source in our project Schema. We'll connect a `REST API` using our `DEMO Hygraph API`.


![Configuring our remote source](https://hygraph.com/images/docs/getting-started/add_remote_source_to_schema.gif)

Enter the following data into the form presented:

table:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Display name | Product Source |
| Type | REST |
| Base URL | https://federatethis.com/api |
| Custom type definitions | Our SDLs (see below) |

### Product SDLs

These SDLs are available in the [Product Route documentation](/routes/products/). We'll use these SDLs to configure the GraphQL types for the Products.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Product">
    This SDL gives the field-level information for a singular product.
```graphql
type Product {
  id: Int
  name: String
  price: Int
  description: String
  image: String
  category: String
  rating: Float
  numReviews: Int
  countInStock: Int
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Products">
  This SDL creates a type for a list of products.
```graphql
type Products {
  data: [Product]
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ProductMeta">
    This SDL creates a type for a singular product that gets returned by the API.
```graphql
type ProductMeta {
  data: Product
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Review SDLs
These SDLs are available in the [Review Route documentation](/routes/reviews/). We'll use these SDLs to configure the GraphQL types for the Reviews.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Review">
  This SDL gives the field-level information for a singular review.
```graphql
type Review {
    id: Int
    product: Int
    productSlug: String
    name: String
    rating: Float
    comment: String
}
```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Reviews">
    This SDL creates a type for a list of reviews.
```graphql
type Reviews {
  data: [Review]
}
```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="ReviewMeta">
    This SDL creates a type for a singular review that gets returned by the API.
```graphql
type ReviewMeta {
  data: Review
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your finished remote source should look like this:

## Add a top-level remote source query

Now that we have our remote source configured, we can add a top-level query to our schema. This will allow us to query our remote source from our project.

From the Schema section, click the Queries system model from the models list. This is where we can add queries directly to the top of our Hygraph API.

On a new project, the queries model will be empty. Since we added a REST Remote Source, we'll add a REST Remote Source Field from the list on the right.

Add the following data to the form presented:
| Tab         | Field               | Input                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Settings    | Display name        | Products                                                                                                                                             |
| Settings    | API ID              | Completing the display name will autocomplete the `API ID` field. We'll leave this value as it is.                                                  |
| Settings    | Remote source       | `Product Source` is selected by default. We'll leave this value as it is.                                                                                |
| Settings    | Method              | `GET` is selected by default. We'll leave this value as it is.                                                                                      |
| Settings    | Return type         | Use the dropdown to select `Products`, which is one of the `custom type definitions` we configured for our remote source.                 |                                  
| Settings    | Path                | Write `/products` here. <br></br>This path will be added to our remote source base path to get a resulting endpoint.   |


## Query the Remote Source

Now that we have our remote source configured and a query to access it, we can query our remote source from our project. For now, head to the API Playground in your project. 

You can use the API explorer to build your `projects` query or use the query below and you should have the response listed.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Query">
```graphql
query MyQuery {
  products {
    data {
      category
      name
      price
      countInStock
      description
      id
      image
      numReviews
      rating
    }
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Response">
```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "data": [
        {
          "category": "Category 1",
          "name": "Product 1",
          "price": 100,
          "countInStock": 10,
          "description": "This is product 1",
          "id": 1,
          "image": "https://picsum.photos/200/300",
          "numReviews": 10,
          "rating": 4.5
        },
        {
          "category": "Category 2",
          "name": "Product 2",
          "price": 200,
          "countInStock": 10,
          "description": "This is product 2",
          "id": 2,
          "image": "https://picsum.photos/200/300",
          "numReviews": 10,
          "rating": 4.5
        },
        {
          "category": "Category 3",
          "name": "Product 3",
          "price": 300,
          "countInStock": 10,
          "description": "This is product 3",
          "id": 3,
          "image": "https://picsum.photos/200/300",
          "numReviews": 10,
          "rating": 4.5
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
